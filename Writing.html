      <td><h4>The lunar eclipse</h4>
      <p>In the night of the lunar eclipse <br>
  I am coming to terms with my sadness.<br>
  I cannot any longer supress<br>
  the volcano of burning emotions.<br>
  I am burning inside.<br>
  To extinguish this fire<br>
  I resort to the tearful lakes<br>
  hidden behind the reed of my eyelashes.<br>
  So many strangers pass by every day...<br>
  but again and again I choose you,<br>
  the strangest of the strangers,<br>
  the most elusive of all my illusions,<br>
  the darkest of my fears,<br>
  the brightest of my dreams,<br>
  my last and my lost hope,<br>
  my inspiration and my desperation...<br>
  Pain is the answer to love.<br>
  Love is the answer to pain.<br>
  The circle has locked around the full moon,<br>
  the destiny casting a shadow over my face.<br>
  </p></td>
     <td><h4>My heart</h4>
     <p>My heart is a vessel of void<br>
  That was only recently full of love.<br>
  The substance was so hot<br>
  That evaporated with time<br>
  Until nothing was left.<br>
  And I touched the end of the light.<br>
  And I felt the edge of the dark.<br>
  And I tasted the nothingness in between.<br>
  It took me some time to get used to living<br>
  With a hole full of nothing inside me.<br>
  But I was surrounded by many people<br>
  Who also lived with a black hole inside,<br>
  And they believed it was right.<br>
  "Love is only a mirage", they said,<br>
  "It's not a real thing".<br>
  Then came the day<br>
  When I completely woke up<br>
  To the real world,<br>
  The world that had no love...<br>
  <br>
  </p></td>
  <td><h4>My way</h4>
    <p>The night was long and dark and full of fear.<br>
And through the woods of broken hopes alone<br>
I paced and shadows wouldn't disappear.<br>
I was so lost, so sad and missing home.<br>
<br>
My clothes were torn on ugly twisting twigs.<br>
Deprived of sleep, I was run down and tired.<br>
My heart was broken into tiny bits.<br>
My mind was void. My body was on fire.<br>
<br>
This misery will never end, I thought<br>
But something touched me with a mighty wing<br>
That was a sign of the divine support -<br>
A feather fell into my palm with a swing<br>
<br>
And I was led through gloom and doom and out<br>
And giggling creepy creatures gave me way<br>
And this is how my way at last was found<br>
The night was over and a bright new day<br>
Began...<br>
</p>
  </td>
      <td><h4>My love</h4>
      <p>My love is like an amber insect,<br>
      Which is forever there,<br>
      In its translucent cage,<br>
      Silver-chained and steady<br>
      In the hollow between my breasts,<br>
      Right on the Anahata chakra,<br>
      Still and silent,<br>
      Helpless and hopeless,<br>
      And never able to fly again.<br>
      So dead... So beautiful...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
